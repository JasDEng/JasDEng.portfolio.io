## Overview
As a student with double major, I spent my first two years of college with a Theoretical and Applied Mechanics major at Sun Yat-Sen University, a top ten university in China. From there, I was admitted to a cooperation program and had an opportunity to earn a second Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue School of Engineering and Technology.

It has been an interesting and meaningful experience to fulfill my undergraduate study in two completely different cultures and educational styles. In China, where the school focuses more on the theoretical side of science and technology, I obtained an outstanding knowledge base for Sciences and Mathematics. In the United States, where schools highly encourage students to apply their expertise to practical engineering problems, I am learning to participate in researches and design projects. Studying in two different cultures also helped me to become a fast learner as well as someone who can adapt to different environments and styles of learning quickly.

I have a strong desire to seek advanced study in order to conduct research of interest on humanoid robot, and finally work in this field. In view of the fact that robotics is inseparable from various of skills, such as programming, system and performance analysis, it is significant for me to continue studying.
